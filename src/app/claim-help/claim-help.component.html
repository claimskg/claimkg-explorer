<h2> What is Claims Explorer?</h2>
<br/>
<p>
		This is an exploratory search engine operating over ClaimsKG, a knowledge graph of fact-checked annotated claims, extracted from fact-checking web-sites. <br/>
		 ClaimsKG facilitates structured queries about claims, their truth values, authors, dates and other kinds of metadata.<br/>
		  It is generated through a (semi-)automated pipeline, which harvests data from popular fact-checking sites on a regular basis, lifts these data into an RDF/S model, which exploits established vocabularies such as <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> and NIF, and annotates claims with related entities from DBpedia.<br/>
		  This is the result of the work of 2 French research teams — LIRMM (Montpellier) and LGI2P (Ales) —  in cooperation with 2 research teams from Germany — GESIS (Cologne) and L3S (Hannover).<br/>
		  For more information, please visit <a href="https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/site/"> https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/site/ </a>. <br/>

	Our data harvesting and publication process is in alignment with the copyright restrictions of the respective fact-checking websites. <br/>

<h2> The meaning of the search tools </h2>	
<br/>
		<li> <strong>Entities</strong>
			<p> This search bar allow you to type any entities in it. It can be human beings such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin for instance or things like White House, Mont-Blanc. If any of the things you typed appears in the claim then the claim will be in the results pages. </p>
		</li>
		<li> <strong>Keywords</strong>
			<p> This is where you can type some words, which are being used to tag the claim. For example if a claim is about the US collusion probe then it might get tagged Trump. </p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Truth rating</strong>
			<p> This criteria refers to the credibility given to the claims according to the website from where it got extracted. Every website has its own ranking but in this interface only 4 types of truth ratings are possible (taken from the normalised rating scheme of ClaimsKG): True, Mixte when the sources are split about the truth of this claim, False and Other when we can't get any data about the truthfulness. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Author</strong>
			<p> Here you can fill in the author of the claims you want to look at. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Time period</strong>
			<p>You can select a start date and an end date which will define the time period of the claims you're looking for. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Languages</strong>
			<p> You can check a box to get only the claim in a certain language. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Sources</strong>
			<p>If you choose a fact-checking website on this research bar (e.g.,Snopes) you will only get the claims coming originally from the selected website. </p>
